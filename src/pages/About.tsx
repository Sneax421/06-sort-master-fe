        <p className="mb-4">
          Waste containers are used for collecting, temporarily storing, and properly disposing of household and industrial waste. They play an important role in maintaining cleanliness in urban and rural areas, and in organizing effective waste management systems.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          There are different types of containers depending on the kind of waste: plastic, paper, glass, organic, and mixed waste. This separation helps sort materials efficiently and send recyclable items to the appropriate processing facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Waste sorting helps reduce landfill overload, minimizes environmental pollution, and allows valuable resources to be reused. Installing and properly using containers is an essential step toward a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.
